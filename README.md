# HW5-Task-Planner

This task planner utilizes local storage to remember tasks entered at specific hours of the planner and maintain an up to date list to assist in day to day activities. When an hour has been passed, the text area becomes greyed out. At the present hour, the text area becomes red, and future hours are enveloped in green. The planner uses moment to assess what color the hour should be. Save buttons will save their respective hours' text areas.

Initially, I had the code outside of for loops, creating a lot of clutter. I figured out a more optimal means of automating the operations to create more clarity in the processes and make the functionality feel more simple and concise.
